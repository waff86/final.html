    My name is Brian Wafula, im 30 years old, i grea up in Lavington Breaside in Nairobi. I attended my early childhood education in St Mary's school lavington afterwhich i joined United States University where i pursued a degree in International Business Addminstration.
After my schooling i was lucky enough to find employment at Nation Media where i used to work as a researcher for The Buzz magazine. Later on i sought employment in Metropol East Africa where i took up the position of a sheria house loans investigator until 2015 when i set up my own business Twenty Eight Enterprisess.
During my day to day running of the business i realised i needed an I.T background thats why i decided to join Moringa School and empower my self in order to move a step up in life.
My intrest is unfortunatley in the automotive industry and my major hobby is racing, im also a member of JDM auto and Subaru Owners Assosiation.
